# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
#
# Sources of coal-combustion can be found in source code classification table (scc)
# Where coal-combustion sources can be drawn from:
#   unique(scc[grepl("(?=.*Comb)(?=.*Coal)", scc$EI.Sector, perl = T), "EI.Sector"])
#
# The unique coal combustion sources (EI.Sector) are:
# [1] "Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal"
# [2] "Fuel Comb - Industrial Boilers, ICEs - Coal"
# [3] "Fuel Comb - Comm/Institutional - Coal"
#
# So need to get all SCC codes that fall into these EI sectors.
