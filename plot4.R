# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
#
# Sources of coal-combustion can be found in source code classification table (scc)
# Where coal-combustion sources can be drawn from:
#   coal <- grep("coal", scc$EI.Sector, ignore.case = T, value = T)
#
# The unique coal combustion sources (EI.Sector) are:
# [1] "Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal"
# [2] "Fuel Comb - Industrial Boilers, ICEs - Coal"
# [3] "Fuel Comb - Comm/Institutional - Coal"
# So need to get all SCC codes that fall into these EI sectors.
#
# You can check this with:
# coalscc <- scc[grep("coal", scc$EI.Sector, ignore.case = T), c("SCC", "Data.Category", "EI.Sector", "Short.Name")]

#
# Load data
#

nei <- readRDS("data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
scc <- readRDS("data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

#
# Summarise
#

# make sure we have packages installed to run analysis
if (!require("dplyr")) {

# get SCC (source code classification) digits for coal combustion related sources
coalscc <- data.frame(SCC = as.character(scc[grep("coal", scc$EI.Sector, ignore.case = T), "SCC"]))
